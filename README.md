# LLMRP
A Character RP Website that runs Entirely Locally VIA Ollama.


# This project is still under development!
Currently, i am in need of AI Character websites so i can prepare a tool that will allow you to download characters from them and keep them locally.

Here is the list i have currently:

- https://janitorai.com/
- https://chub.ai/
- https://pephop.ai/

Here are websites i **COULD** add support for but they would be limited:
- https://crushon.ai/ (Public Definitions Only)
- https://character.ai/ (Public Definitions Only)
